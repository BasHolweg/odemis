This is a simple example on how to acquire a "spectrum cube" on the SPARC in a 
script.
run as:
cl_acquisition sed.h5 spect.h5

You first need to run the odemis backend with the SPARC config:
odemisd --log-level 2 install/linux/usr/share/odemis/sparc-amolf.odm.yaml

To change some configuration settings, you can use the cli:
# to change the yaw of the mirror (by 10 um):
odemis-cli --move MirrorMover rz -10
# to change the center bandwidth of the spectrograph (to 520 nm):
odemis-cli --position SP2300i wavelength 0.520
# to change the resolution of the SEM (i.e., number of points acquired):
odemis-cli --set-attr "EBeam ExtXY" resolution "20, 10"
# to change the exposure time of the spectrometer (to 100 ms):
odemis-cli --set-attr Spec10 exposureTime 0.1
# to change the binning of the Angle-Resolved camera:
odemis-cli --set-attr ARCam binning "2, 2"

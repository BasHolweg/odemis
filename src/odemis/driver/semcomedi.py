from odemis import model

# This is a module to drive a FEI Scanning electron microscope via the so-called
# "external X/Y" line. It uses a DA-conversion and acquisition (DAQ) card on the
# computer side to control the X/Y position of the electron beam (e-beam), while
# receiving the intensity sent by the secondary electron and/or backscatter
# detector. The DAQ card is handled via the (Linux) Comedi interface.
#
# Although it should in theory be quite generic, this driver is only tested on
# Linux with Comedilib 0.8.1, with a NI PCI 6251 DAQ card, and a FEI Quanta SEM.
#
# From the point of view of Odemis, this driver provides several HwComponents.
# The e-beam position control is represented by an Scanner (Emitter) component,
# while each detector is represented by a separate Detector device.
#
# The pin connection should be the following for the NI PCI 6251:
# Scanner X : AO0/AO GND = pins 22/55
# Scanner Y : AO1/AO GND = pins 21/54
# SED : AI1/AI GND = pins 33/32
# BSD : AI2/AI GND = pins 65/64
# SCB-68 Temperature Sensor differential : AI0+/AI0- = AI0/AI8 = pins 68/34 (by jumper)
#

    We describe the component that drives the BlinkStick led controller and
    performs the communication with the device. This controller will be used to
    control the white led configuration in SECOM. A series of leds is connected
    via the same channel to one of the RGB outputs of BlinkStick controller (we
    assume red). The same intensity has to be set to each and every led of the
    series. Additionally we provide a fake version of this component that
    imitates the operation and behavior of the actual BlinkStick for testing
    purposes.

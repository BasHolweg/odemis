### Purpose ###

This module contains classes that describe images produced by hardware
components.

"""

class InstrumentalImage(object):
    """ A light wrapper around a wx.Image and meta data about where it is taken.
    """

    # It'd be best to have it as a subclass of wx.Image, but wxPython has many
    # functions which return a wx.Image. We'd need to "override" them as well.

    def __init__(self, wx_img, mpp=None, center=None, rotation=0.0):
        """
        wx_img (None or wx.Image)
        mpp (None or float>0): meters per pixel
        center (None or 2-tuple float): position (in meters) of the center of
            the image
        rotation (float): rotation in degrees (i.e., 180 = upside-down)

        Note: When displayed, the scaling, translation, and rotation have to be
        applied "independently": scaling doesn't affect the translation, and
        rotation is applied from the center of the image.

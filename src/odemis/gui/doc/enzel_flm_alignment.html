        <h3>Alignment instructions</h3>

        <h5>Overview alignment</h5>
        <font size="2">
            <ol>
                In this tab, it is possible to align the SEM, FIB and FLM to a single coincidence point.
                The alignment is split in three sections:
            </ol>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Aligning the sample stage to the coincidence height of the FIB and SEM</li>
                <li>Using SEM beam shift to set the coincidence point of the FIB and SEM</li>
                <li>Moving the objective stage to align the FLM view to the FIB/SEM coincidence point</li>
            </ol>


            <h5>FLM-alignment instructions</h5>
            <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this section, the objective stage is set to align the FLM view to the FIB/SEM coincidence point.
            Centering the alignment feature on the FLM view and focusing on the feature using the objective stage, the FIB/SEM coincidence point is aligned with the FLM view in X, Y and Z.
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Refresh the SEM view to display the alignment feature that was milled in the previous step.</li>
            <li>Set the FLM imaging conditions to reflection imaging.</li>
            <li>Focus the FLM on the grid using the +Z and -Z buttons (NOTE: if this is the first alignment after loading the sample, the objective is automatically moved away from the sample, the sample should be located approximately 100 um above the starting focal plane).</li>
            <li>Using the +/- X and Y buttons, center the FLM view on the alignment feature.</li>
            <li>The 3 beam alignment is finished.</li>
        </ol>

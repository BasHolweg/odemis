            <li>Use the chamber camera on the SEM if available or the chamber view in the
                chamber tab to visualize the sample position with respect to the mirror.
                Move the sample close to the bottom of the mirror by moving the SEM-stage
                along the z axis.</li>
            <li>Turn off all the lights in the chamber.</li>
            <!-- TODO: once background acquisition is supported
            <li>blank the beam</li>
            <li>Acquire background image</li>
            <li>Unblank the beam</li>-->
            <li>Ensure a CL-emitting part of the sample is at the center of SEM-image.</li>
            <li>Set the SEM to external scanning (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Move in the x-direction to make the spot image horizontally symmetric.</li>
            <li>Move in the y-direction to minimize the spot size and
                to maximize the spot intensity.</li>
            <li>Move the SEM stage up (z-direction) to also minimize the spot size and
                to maximize the spot intensity.</li>
            <li>Reiterate the x-, y- and z-alignment until you have a small, round spot.</li>
            <li>In case the alignment is completely lost, set the SEM to a small magnification
                so that the hole is visible in the SE-image. Then center the
                mirror hole in the SEM-image by moving the x- and y-axes.</li>

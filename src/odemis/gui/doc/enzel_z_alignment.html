        <h5>Overview alignment</h5>
        <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this tab, it is possible to align the SEM, FIB and FLM to a single coincidence point.
            The alignment is split in three sections:
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Aligning the sample stage to the coincidence height of the FIB and SEM</li>
            <li>Using SEM beam shift to set the coincidence point of the FIB and SEM</li>
            <li>Moving the objective stage to align the FLM view to the FIB/SEM coincidence point</li>
        </ol>


        <h5>Z-alignment instructions</h5>
        <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this section, the coincidence plane of the SEM and FIB is determined by setting the correct sample stage Z coordinate.
            At the correct sample stage Z, a selected feature will line up vertically (on the same horizontal line) in both SEM and FIB image.
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a similar magnification of both SEM and FIB using the microscope software and refresh both the FIB and SEM image in Odemis. A good starting magnification for this alignment is 1000-5000x.</li>
            <li>Select a feature in the SEM image and navigate so that the feature is in the center of the SEM view.</li>
            <li>Refresh the FIB view.</li>
            <li>Using the +Z and -Z buttons, line up the same feature on the horizontal line in the FIB image.</li>
            <li>Refresh both SEM and FIB view to verify the feature is aligned.</li>
            <li>Continue to the SEM alignment</li>
        </ol>

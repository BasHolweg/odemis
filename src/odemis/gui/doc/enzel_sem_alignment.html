      <h5>Overview alignment</h5>
      <font size="2">
          <ol>
              In this tab, it is possible to align the SEM, FIB and FLM to a single coincidence point.
              The alignment is split in three sections:
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>
              <li>Aligning the sample stage to the coincidence height of the FIB and SEM</li>
              <li>Using SEM beam shift to set the coincidence point of the FIB and SEM</li>
              <li>Moving the objective stage to align the FLM view to the FIB/SEM coincidence point</li>
          </ol>


          <h5>SEM-alignment instructions</h5>
          <font size="2">
        <ol>
            In this section, the coincidence point of the FIB and SEM is accurately set by setting the SEM beam shift.
            By using the FIB to mill a small feature in the carbon foil, an accurate coincidence point between FIB and SEM is set.
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>

            <li>Using the SEM image, navigate to an area on the grid that has exposed carbon foil that will allow fast milling of an alignment feature.</li>
            <li>Set a similar magnification of both SEM and FIB using the TFS microscope software and refresh both the FIB and SEM image in Odemis. A good starting magnification for this alignment is 5000-10000x.</li>
            <li>Using the TFS microscope software, mill a small circular alignment feature in the center of the view.</li>
            <li>Refresh the FIB view to display the alignment feature on screen.</li>
            <li>Play the SEM view.</li>
            <li>Using the beam shift control buttons, center the SEM view on the alignment feature.</li>
            <li>Continue to the FLM alignment.</li>
        </ol>

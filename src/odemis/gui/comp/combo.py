    """ A simple sub class of OwnerDrawnComboBox that prevents a white border
    from showing around the combobox and allows for left/right caret
    navigation with the arrow keys.

    OwnerDrawnComboBox consists of a ComboCtrl, which a child TextCtrl. The
    problem with the white border comes from the fact that the background colour
    of the ComboCtrl cannot be set. Any call to that method will only result in
    the TextCtrl changing colour.

    Getting rid of margins also didn't help, since the top margin is 'stuck' at
    -1, which causes the ComboCtrl's white background colour to show.

    In the end, the solution was to draw the background ourselves, using the correct colour.

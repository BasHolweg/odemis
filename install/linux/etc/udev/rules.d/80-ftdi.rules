# Force the devices connected via a serial-over-USB FTDI to get explicit names
# Many devices use this hardware, and quite a few don't bother changing the 
# vendor/product IDs. It's convenient because the standard driver works out of
# the box, but then we have no idea what is what when many hardwares are
# connected.

# They have different serial number, so it could be possible to either have
# a persistent rule, or have our small lookup table of serial -> device type 

# All we can do is to at least separate them from the other serial-over-USB hw.
# Currently, the following hardware devices are known to provide these IDs:
# * Lumencor Light Engine
# * Omicron xX
# * Thorlabs filter wheel

# => add a symlink ttyFTDIxx with the same number as the ttyUSBxx file

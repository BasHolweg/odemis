How to install Odemis

= Installing the dependencies = 
You need Ubuntu 12.04 (x86 - 32 bits).
sudo apt-get python-wxgtk2.8 python-imaging python-yaml python-gdal python-serial python-zmq

= Installing Odemis =

git clone git@github.com:delmic/Pyro4.git
git clone git@github.com:delmic/odemis.git

sudo mkdir /var/run/odemisd/
chmod a+rwx /var/run/odemisd/

= Installing the vendor device drivers =
== Andor Clara camera ==
Install Andor SDK (USB product). 
Warning not all versions work:
* v2.93 doesn't work because it blocks after a few image acquired
* v2.90 doesn't support changing the preamp gain
* v2.91 and v2.92 use 100% of CPU when acquiring images

On Linux/Ubuntu you need to install libusb-dev (so that whereis reports libusb.so).
Also the the permissions of all the files must be allowed for normal user: everything is installed by default as root only, so nothing can work from the normal user account. See /usr/local/*/*andor*
Finally, fix /etc/udev/rules.d/andor.rules to read as:
ATTRS{idVendor}=="136e", MODE="0666"
For example:
sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/andor.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules


== Andor Neo camera ==
Install Andor SDK v3.3+
On Linux, the bitflow driver has to be reinstalled (recompiled) each time the kernel is updated.

== Physik Instrumente C-170 piezo-motor controllers ==
Nothing specific. Make sure that the normal user has permissions to access the serial port. 
For example, if it is a USB serial port adapter check the permissions of /dev/ttyUSB0.
